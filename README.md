--------------------------------------------

Launch UniversalSaveTool.exe.

You can create, edit, delete, and duplicate profiles in the profile tab.

Click 'Browse' next to 'Load Save' to change where you save your backup saves (/Saves/ is chosen by default). Feel free to make your own folders and Browse between them.
Select the save you want to load from the list that populates.

Dynamic Save Slots can be enabled for games that change the filename when saves are overwritten. (THIS IS RARE AND SHOULD ONLY BE USED WHEN YOU KNOW IT APPLIES TO YOUR GAME!)

Click 'Browse' next to "Save Slot" to navigate to your saves folder (Documents/Dead Space (2023)/settings/steam - Save Locations for other games are varied).
Select the save slot you want to write to (AS-000.sav).

Some games require your save file to be injected into 2 places (ie. Lies of P). Check the Secondary Save Slot and choose the 2nd save slot to overwrite. You can toggle this off at anytime to return to singular save file injections. NOTE: Your keybind to create a save will only make a save from the Primary Save Slot!

Click 'Bind Key' to change your binding for any of the listed functions in the keybinds tab.

Sound can be toggled with the 'Audio' check button found in the About tab.

Press 'Reset' to return all tool features to their installed defaults. THIS CANNOT BE UNDONE! The program will exit. You can find this button in the About tab.

Once you're set up, use your hotkeys to create, load, and rename your practice saves!

--------------------------------------------

FOR DEAD SPACE REMAKE IMPOSSIBLE MODE: MAKE SURE WHICHEVER SAVE SLOT YOU PICK IS ALREADY ON IMPOSSIBLE OR THE INJECT WILL BE ON HARD MODE!
