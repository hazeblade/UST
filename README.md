Universal Save Tool

version 1.2.0
by Hazeblade

--------------------------------------------

Launch UniversalSaveTool.exe.

You can create, edit, delete, and duplicate profiles with the top buttons for easier setup on multiple games.

Click 'Browse' under 'Choose a Save File' to change where you save your backup saves (HBSaveTool/Saves is chosen by default). Feel free to make your own folders and Browse between them.
Select the save you want to load from the list that populates.

Click 'Refresh' the list box during your session if you make changes to any related files outside of the program. 

Click 'Browse' under "Save Slot" to navigate to your saves folder (Documents/Dead Space (2023)/settings/steam - Save Locations for other games are varied).
Select the save slot you want to write to (AS-000.sav).

Some games require your save file to be injected into 2 places (ie. Lies of P). Check the Secondary Save Slot and choose the 2nd save slot to overwrite. You can toggle this off at anytime to return to singular save file injections. NOTE: Your keybind to create a save will only make a save from the Primary Save Slot!

Click 'Bind Key' to change your binding for any of the listed functions.

Sound can be toggled with the 'Audio' check button.

Press 'Reset' to return all tool features to their installed defaults. THIS CANNOT BE UNDONE! The program will exit.

Once you're set up, use your hotkeys to create, load, and rename your practice saves!

--------------------------------------------

FOR DEAD SPACE REMAKE IMPOSSIBLE MODE: MAKE SURE WHICHEVER SAVE SLOT YOU PICK IS ALREADY ON IMPOSSIBLE OR THE INJECT WILL BE ON HARD MODE!
